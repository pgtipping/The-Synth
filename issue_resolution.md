# Audio Upload Implementation Issue Resolution

## Initial Error

`[Parchment] Unable to create audio blot`

## Investigation Steps & Findings

### Step 1: Initial Implementation Review

- Reviewed `AudioBlot` implementation in `src/components/editor/formats/audioBlot.ts`
- Confirmed registration in `src/components/editor/formats/index.ts`
- Verified import and registration under 'formats/audio'

### Step 2: Hydration Error Resolution

- Identified hydration error due to accessing Quill sources at module level
- Moved Quill sources initialization into useEffect hook
- Added state management for Quill sources using useState
- Result: Hydration error resolved

### Step 3: Audio Upload Testing

- Added debug logging to track registration process
- Console output shows:

  ```text
  "All formats registered successfully"
  "Starting audio upload handler"
  "Available formats: []"  // Empty array indicates no formats registered
  "Error: quillSources.find is not a function"
  ```

### Step 4: Enhanced Format Registration Logging

- Added detailed logging to track format registration process:
  - Quill version and initial registry state
  - Individual format module import status
  - Format map construction and registration
  - Final registry state after registration
- Purpose: To identify potential timing issues or registration failures

### Current Issues

1. Format Registration:

   - Despite "All formats registered successfully" message, formats array is empty
   - This suggests a timing issue with format registration
   - Possible disconnect between Quill's format registration and runtime availability

2. Quill Sources:
   - `quillSources.find` is not a function despite being set in useEffect
   - This indicates potential issues with how we're accessing Quill's static methods

### Attempted Solutions

1. Moving Quill sources to useEffect:

   - Status: Partially successful
   - Fixed hydration error but introduced new issues with find method

2. Direct Quill access in handleAudioUpload:

   - Status: In progress
   - Added direct Quill require in handler
   - Need to verify if this approach resolves the find method issue

3. Enhanced Format Registration Logging:
   - Status: In progress
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the registration process
   - Awaiting test results to analyze registration flow

### Open Questions

1. Why are formats showing as empty array despite successful registration?
2. Is there a race condition between Quill initialization and format registration?
3. Should AudioBlot registration be handled differently from other formats?
4. Is the format registration happening before Quill is fully initialized?

### Next Steps

1. Review enhanced logging output to understand registration flow
2. Consider implementing a registration confirmation check
3. Investigate if formats need to be registered at a different point in the component lifecycle
4. Review Quill documentation for proper format registration timing
